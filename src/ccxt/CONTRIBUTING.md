### MultiLanguage Support

The ccxt library is available in three different languages (more to come). One of the primary objectives for developers is to design *portable* code, so that a single-language user can read code in other languages and understand it easily. This helps the adoption of the library. The main goal is to provide a generalized, unified, consistent and robust interface to as many existing cryptocurrency exchanges as possible.

At first, all language-specific version were developed in parallel, but separately from each other. But when it became too hard to maintain and keep the code consistent among all supported languages we decided to switch to what we call a *master/copy* process. There is now a single master version in one language, that is JavaScript. Other language-specific versions are syntactically derived (transpiled, generated) from the master version. But it doesn't mean that you have to be a JS coder to contribute. The portability principle allows Python and PHP devs to effectively participate in developing the master version as well.

### Ad-Hoc Transpiler

There is a custom utility script in the root of the repository, named `transpile.js` that derives versions in other languages from the master code. The script converts language syntax from JS to Python/PHP and it is itself written in JavaScript. The transpiler does its job by sequentially applying series of regexp substitutions to perform one-to-one (line-to-line) mapping from JS to other languages.

### Dependencies

```UNDER CONSTRUCTION```

### Single Source Of Version Number

The version number is sourced to JavaScript, Python and PHP from the main NPM package file `package.json`. The `publish.sh` script updates the version and exports it to all other files. This is done by the `vss.js` script, which stands for *version-single-sourcing*. Python package config function inside `setup.py` also reads that JSON file to update the version in Python Package Index (PyPI).

```UNDER CONSTRUCTION```

### Master/Slave Files

The ccxt library includes one single file per each language:

```shell
/ccxt/__init__.py  # slave Python-version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.es5.js       # slave JavaScript ES5 version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.js           # master JS ES6 version of the ccxt library
/ccxt.php          # slave PHP version of the ccxt library
```

Slave files and docs are partially-generated from the master `ccxt.js` file by the `build.sh` script:
```shell
#!/bin/bash

npm run export-markets && # export-markets.js → README.md and ../ccxt.wiki/*
npm run mdrst &&          # pandoc:       README.md → README.rst for PyPI
npm run transpile &&      # transpile.js: ccxt.js → ccxt/__init__.py and ccxt.php 
npm run build             # babel:        ccxt.js → ccxt.es5.js
```

The structure of the master/slave file can be outlined like this:

```
      +--------------------------+ ← beginning of file
h  /  |                          |
e  |  |  common stuff            |
a  |  |                          |  
d <   //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler comment is used to separate code blocks 
e  |  |                          |
r  |  |  base market class       |   above this first bold line all code is language-specific
   \  |                          |                    ↑
      //=========================+ ← first 'bold' horizontal ruler comment
   /  |                          |                    ↓
   |  |  derived market class A  |   below this line all code can be ported to other languages
   |  |                          |
b  |  //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler used to separate derived classes
o  |  |                          |
d <   |  derived market class B  |
y  |  |                          |
   |  //-------------------------+
   |  |                          |
   |  | ...                      |   above this line all code is transpileable
   \  |                          |                    ↑
      //=========================+ ← second 'bold' horizontal ruler comment
f  /  |                          |                    ↓
o  |  |  other code              |   below this second bold line all code is language-specific
o  |  |                          |
t <   //-------------------------+ ← thin horizontal ruler comment is used to separate code blocks 
e  |  |                          |   
r  |  |  other code              |   
   \  |                          |
      //-------------------------+ ← end of file
```

Key notes on the structure of the library file:

- thin ruler comments are there for code block separation
- bold ruler comments are there to separate language-specific base code from language-agnostic derived implementations
- bold rulers are marker hints for the transpiler to quickly find the code for conversion
- the second bold ruler and footer are optional

### Derived Market Classes

Below are key notes on how to keep the JS code transpileable:

- do not use language-specific code syntax sugar, even if you really want to

- unfold all maps and comprehensions to basic for-loops

- always use Python-style indentation, it is preserved as is for all languages

- always put a semicolon (`;`) at the end of each statement, as in PHP/C-style

- all associative keys must be single-quoted strings everywhere (`array['good'], array.bad`)

- all local variables should be declared with `let` keyword

- do everything with base class methods only

- if you need another base method you will have to implement it in the base class in all three languages

- try to reduce syntax to basic one-liner statements

- multiple lines are ok, but you should avoid deep nesting with lots of brackets

- do not use conditional statements that are too complex

## How To Set Up Your Environment

```UNDER CONSTRUCTION```

## Bulding

- `/build.sh`
- `/update-version.sh`
- `/publish.sh`

```UNDER CONSTRUCTION```

## Testing

By default the test scripts run through all markets to fetch tickers, order books and balances (conducts a basic test of public and private APIs).

- `/test.js` run by Node.js / NPM
- `/test.php` run by PHP
- `/test.py` run by Python 2 / 3

### Test Configurations

### Test Params

All tests accept one or two optional arguments like shown below:
```shell
# Usage:
    node test.js [marketId [symbol]]
    python test.py [marketId [symbol]]
    php -f test.php [marketId [symbol]]
# Examples:
    node test.js kraken
    node test.js gdax BTC/USD
    python test.py btce
    python test.py bitfinex ETH/BTC
    php -f test.php hitbtc
    php -f test.php zaif BTC/JPY
```

If arguments are specified, each test will only run for a particular market id and symbol. This might be helpful to run a partial test.
